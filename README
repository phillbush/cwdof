                                 cwdof

cwdof is a simple utility to get the curent working directory of a given
process in OpenBSD.


§ Files

The files are the following.
• ./README:         This file.
• ./Makefile:       The makefile.
• ./config.mk:      The setup for the makefile.
• ./cwdof.c:        The source code of cwdof.
• ./cwdof.1:        The manual page for cwdof.


§ Instalation

First, edit ./config.mk to match your local setup.

Enter the following command to build cwdof.  This command creates the
binary file ./cwdof.

	make

By default, cwdof is installed into the /usr/local prefix.  Enter the
following command to install cwdof (if necessary as root).  This command
installs the binary file ./cwdof into the ${PREFIX}/bin/ directory, and
the manual file ./cwdof.1 into ${MANPREFIX}/man1/ directory.

	make install


§ Running cwdof

cwdof(1) receives as single argument the pid (process ID) of a process,
and prints to stdout the current working directory of this process.
